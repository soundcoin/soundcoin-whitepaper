Abstract:

A new series of decentralized cryptocurrencies backed by physical commodities.

Problems with todays monetary practices:

Today’s currency markets are dominated by fiat currencies, and undermined by unsound monetary practices. These unsound practices create complex socioeconomic problems worldwide; enabling never-ending wars, inciting systemic oppression of the majority of socioeconomic classes, and ultimately keep the overwhelming majority of people bound as slaves to the money masters. 

With central banks creating money seemingly out of thin air, and backed only by debt, long term viability of these currencies is doubtful. This coupled with growing privacy concerns have led to the emergence of many alternative currencies which are decentralized in nature (ie P2P cryptocurrencies). These currencies offer many benefits such as a distributed transaction accounting, anonymity, predictable supply growth rate, and independence from any single group’s monopoly over the supply or issuance of the currency. 

Recently cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular alternatives to centralized fiat currencies, because of low transaction fees, and because they have predictable, transparent growth rates. At the time of writing this, 12.2 million bitcoins are in circulation valued at $826.00 USD each. That’s over 10 billion US dollars-worth of bitcoins in circulation since its inception in 2009. People are transitioning naturally to currencies like bitcoin because they offer many advantages that USD or other central backs cannot. 

While cryptocurrencies like bitcoin solve many of the problems of centralized currency, these currencies are still fiat, meaning they are backed by nothing tangible in the real world. Historically, fiat currencies are relatively short lived and at the end of their lifespan can be catastrophic to its holders.

The central banking power structure is undesirable to many because the power to create money and lend it lies in the hands of an elite power class, whom  have  a stranglehold on not only the money supply, but also the government entities whose initial purpose was to protect the people from this very threat. 

The proposed solution:
	Adoption of a new resource backed cryptocurrency called Soundcoin, with a decentralized network confirming, and verifying transactions across the network; backed by physical resources, in this case silver.  It allows for anonymous transactions, divisibility in any increment, extremely fast transactions with small  
A central issuing authority whom is regularly independently audited issues 1 ounce .999 fine silver rounds for sale. These rounds are sold by the issuing mint at a premium. This premium would provide profit motive for the bank and also cover the costs associated with: 
1.	Long term or even indefinite warehousing of the metal.
2.	Administration costs associated with issuing the electronic cryptocurrency securely.
3.	Independent auditing costs ensuring the bank is being honest with its holdings.
4.	Maintaining the system that hold and organizes the physical silver.
5.	Withdrawal fees of a real physical coin with the exception of the true shipping cost.
6.	Payout in the form of more silver by the mint to those verifying transactions on the network, often referred as mining or proof of work.
The physical silver round is purchased and deposited into a container with a Soundcoin address, a secure coin is then issued by the bank to the wallet address of the buyer at a 1:1 ratio (One Soundcoin: one physical silver ounce).  This ratio remains the same all the time keeping the purchasing power of Soundcoin stable in the long term.
The Soundcoin owner can at any time withdraw the physical silver by issuing a withdrawal request as long as the owner has 1 Soundcoin in their wallet. This withdrawal function is essential in verifying the bank is keeping its promise of backing each Soundcoin by physical silver, and instilling confidence in the userbase.

Looking forward:
Like all markets, competing currencies would be beneficial by optimizing the efficiency of each of these new resource backed cryptocurrencies. 
It is only natural to assume among competing banks there would also be competing currencies. Silver, gold, and other metals, oil, the list goes on. All backed by physical resources. These newly emerged cryptocurrencies could then be easily traded on open currency markets like we already see today for example crypto-trade.com
Finding Sovereinty:
While the US has foolishly relied on the dollar’s reserve status to allow for deficit spending higher than ever before in history people are running as fast as they can away from the greenback. And with corruption running rampant in the US, it is no longer a suitable atmosphere to birth an honest and sound currency within its own borders or territories. 
However a few other countries are emerging as the leaders in economic freedom worldwide. One notable country Hong Kong has topped the list for 19 consecutive years according to the Heritage Foundation. 
Since 2008 the small nation of Iceland has been increasingly rejecting the ideas of central banking norms.
Whichever nations become the early adopter of these new ideas will quickly become major players in the currency game.
